<p><h3>FAQ</h3></p>

<p><h5>This slider sucks, why does it jump from $0 to $45,045 to $112,613?</h5><p>
<p>That's literally the width of one pixel at this scale and the slider's gotta fit all potential incomes within the supported range. Just type your income in the box if you want a <em>super specific</em> zero. </p>

<p><h5>This is wrong, 70% of my income is much more than $0?</h5><p>
<p>Yes, but AOC proposed a 70% marginal tax rate at income over $10,000,000. So the 70% kicks in above your ten-millionth dollar. So even if you make $10,000,001 in a year you'd only be paying <em>70 cents</em> extra total in taxes that year under this fairly conservative proposal.</p>

<p><h5>I make more than $10,000,005 per year and it isn't letting me slide above that. Is this tool broken?</h5><p>
<p>No, but you'll have to pay for the premium version of this tool at above $10,000,005. But, not to worry, we offer it on an affordable sliding scale for billionaires at all levels! Just have your people Paypal me 0.001% of your total net worth. If you were a median black Bostonian, that'd be <a href = "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/12/11/that-was-typo-the-median-net-worth-black-bostonians-really/ze5kxC1jJelx24M3pugFFN/story.html" target = "_blank"> less than a penny</a>.</p>

<p><h5>That's a lot of Zeroes!?</h5><p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p><h5>Won't this kill jobs?</h5><p>
<p>No. No individual making anywhere near that amount of money can possibly spend that much money to create useful jobs. While billionaires buy mansions to house their caviar-fed dogs, taxes create useful jobs to provide services including affordable housing and medicine to people.</p>

<p><h5>A marginal tax rate seems like a pretty good idea, any others?</h5><p>
<p>A higher tax on money people make from investments including income from stocks they sell a.k.a. a capital gains tax. Seeing as investors do no work investing yet make incredible profits off of labor, wouldn't it be more fair if that tax were at least comparable to a normal income tax? Shouldn't Warren Buffet pay a higher tax rate than <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/index.html" target="_blank">his secretary</a>?</p>
